# Iconic Baseball Moments

## Overview
A multi-page CRUD application with multiple routes where users can post images that captured baseballâ€™s most iconic moments. The landing page features a carousel of of three images in order to ease the eyes at first glance. The user then has to click on the upper left hand corner on the Iconic Baseball banner in order to access the other routes and CRUD functionality of the app.

It contains a fully self-built database with images, dates, and descriptions that describe the events that occured. This app was built with JavaScript and EJS templating, Express, Node.js and MongoDB as the database. 

## Approach Taken
I first focused on building out the backend in order to get the routes working, connecting it to the database, and testing it out with Postman. Once that was done, I decided to start custom building the database fully and then pivoted to the frontend and styling features of the app.

### Next Steps

- A history section, potentially a carousel as an introduction
- A welcome modal
- Search on navbar
- Styling improvements to the index and show pages
- Adding authentication in order to provide a unique experience for each user where they can personalize it as they wish
